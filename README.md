## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/main.png)

A handy tool for Spotify lovers. It has a simple layout, lets you listen to a song before saving it, and adds metadata to your downloads. It saves you time organizing your music. Give it a try!

## Built With

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Prerequisites

You must have Node JS installed

### Installation

1. Aquire a Spotify Client ID and Secret from a Spotify API app.
2. Create an env file ".env.local" and add each one to CLIENT_ID & CLEINT_SECRET.
3. Open https://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Usage
